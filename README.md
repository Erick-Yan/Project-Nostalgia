Project Nostaligia is an online application that aims to revive the lost art of journaling for those defining moments within your lifetime. Built using a flask, SQL and JavaScript, users will be able to save their memories by filling out a journal entry (form), including unique options such as a song and up to nine photos to optimize their nostalgic experience. The journal entry is then entered into your personal "Timeline" that saves each entry chronologically and can be opened up individually through its designated tabs. Each saved entry allows you to play the song you entered as well as view each photo through a slideshow upon being selected. If not satisfied, the user can always delete the entry. All photos and music are saved under the user's name and the application's database safely. We hope that through this application, people will not only be able to cherish the idea of journaling, but create life-long memories that will be remembered forever.
