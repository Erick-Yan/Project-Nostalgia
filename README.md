# Project Nostalgia

Project Nostaligia is an online application that aims to revive the lost art of journaling for those defining moments you never want to forget. To further enhance the nostalgic experience, we've also enabled users to integrate photos and music into their journal entries.

The site was created with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
